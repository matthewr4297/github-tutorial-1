## Git vs. GitHub
Git: a version control that keep “snapshots” or backup of codes [which can be saved to your computer to add on to later.]

Github: is a website that stores code in the cloud (requires git to operate) to visually track changes. 
It is easily to collaborate on files and it runs in the command line's basic workflow.

## Repository Setup
Setting up a repository (repo) requires __initializing, adding and commiting.__

    Git init- intializes our git into the repo for version control (hiring the family phtographer) 
    Git add- adds any file that is specific into the stage (adding people in the photo)
    Git commit- takes a "snapshot" of the files on the stage (taking the picture)
